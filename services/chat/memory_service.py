        7. Ignore temporary states ("I'm tired today") unless health-related
        8. Convert implied facts to explicit form:

        9. Use this exact format for each fact:

        - Dietary preference: Vegetarian (Confidence: Medium)
        - Occupation: Software engineer (Confidence: High)
        ```
        
        Bad (rejected):
        ```
        - The weather is nice today (Not about user)
        - They talked about machine learning (Not a personal fact)
        - User seems tired (Temporary state)
        ```
        
        **Output**:
        Return only extracted facts in the specified format, one per line.
        If you haven't found any facts, return exactly: `No facts to extract.`
        Don't include any other text or explanations. Don't use bullet points or lists.
